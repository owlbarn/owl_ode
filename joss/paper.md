# Summary

After only three years of intensive development and continuous optimisation, `Owl` has emerged in the `OCaml` ecosystem as a versatile and powerful scientific programming library, competitive with mainstream libraries such as `SciPy` and `NumPy`.
What sets `Owl` apart is that it brings under one umbrella the flexibility of a dynamical language and the power and safety of the `OCaml` type system [@Wang:2017].

Today, `Owl` can be used to solve a wide range of scientific problems: it provides efficient types for handling multidimensional arrays and linear algebra operations built on top of `BLAS` and `LAPACK`; it supports machine learning applications with a powerful computational graph engine and automatic differentiation pipeline.
To improve efficiency, `Owl` allows offloading computations to distributed systems and GPUs.
With the recent addition of `dataframes` and integration with Jupyter Notebooks provided by `ocaml-jupyter`, `Owl` has the chance to become an excellent framework for exploratory mathematical analysis.

A notable omission in `Owl`'s ecosystem, when compared to similar solutions in `python` and `Julia`, was a package for solving ordinary differential equations.
To fill this need, we designed `OwlDE`, a flexible and efficient ODE engine for `Owl`.

## Design of the core module

The lack of automation around type classes and dynamic typing in `OCaml` may seem at first a huge impediment to designing a flexible and ergonomic ODE integrator library.
Indeed, such a library should ideally allow the users to seamlessly use different algorithms that require different kinds of inputs and options, and return varying kinds of outputs.
Such constraints on input/output types pose a major problem for the strong static type system of `OCaml`, even if they are in principle implementable exploiting advanced language features, and were one of the central issues in designing `OwlDE`.

We iterated various options and settled on the use of first-class modules.
These have been introduced in OCaml since version 3.12, and further improved in subsequent releases.
With first-class modules the user can parametrise functions over modules, allowing us to find a middle ground between the verbosity of functorial code and the composability of OCaml functions.
The flexibility of this API allowed us to provide integration and bindings to external frameworks like `SUNDIALS` or `ODEPACK` in a completely seamless way.
Such an API allowed us to compare native implementations with industry-grade solvers, both for mathematical exploration, testing and benchmark purposes.

To give an idea of the interface, the following code allows to integrate the initial value problem

$$
\dot{x} = f(x,t) = A x, \qquad x(t_0) = x_0
$$

where $A$ is the 2x2 matrix $(1, -1; 2, -3)$, $x_0 = (-1; 1)$ and $t_0=0$.

```ocaml
open Owl
open Owl_ode
open Owl_ode.Types

(* f(x,t) *)
let f x t =
   let a = [|[|1.; -1.|];
             [|2.; -3.|]|]
           |> Mat.of_arrays in
   Mat.(a *@ x)

(* temporal specification:
   construct a record using the constructor T1 and
   includes information of start time, duration,
   and step size.*)
let tspec = T1 {t0 = 0.; duration = 2.; dt=1E-3}

(* initial state of the system *)
let x0 = Mat.of_array [|-1.; 1.|] 2 1

(* ts and xs will contain the integrated times and the values of the state
   x at each of those times *)
let ts, xs = Ode.odeint Native.D.rk4 f x0 tspec ()
```

The tight integration with the `OCaml` and `Owl` ecosystem allows us also to benefit from some of their strengths.
The strong static type system made refactoring and code analysis an immediate task, and greatly reduced the necessary test surface.
The powerful functorised `ndarray` subsystem exposed by `Owl` made the library trivially extensible also in somewhat unexpected directions.
Indeed, it is possible to take the integrators exposed by `OwlDE` and use them to reproduce the work of [@NODE:2018] without the need to rewrite any of the core functions, as done in [`adjoint_ode`](https://github.com/tachukao/adjoint_ode).
Similarly, it is possible to extend the range of integrators and introduce new ones rather seamlessly, as done in [`cviode`](https://github.com/mseri/ocaml-cviode), an implementation of the integrators introduced in [@VBS:2019].

One further strength of this library, comes from its native `OCaml` component, which can be compiled to `JavaScript` and used for interactive simulations in the browser, as demoed during the `OCaml` Workshop at ICFP 2019 in Berlin.
The demo and the usage instructions are freely available at [`owlde-demo-icfp2019`](https://github.com/mseri/owlde-demo-icfp2019).

## Conclusion

When it comes to scientific programming, fast prototyping and ease of use have long been considered the province of dynamically-typed languages like `python`.
However, our experience developing `Owl` and `OwlDE`, and the feedback from users who primarily use these tools for research, suggests otherwise.
In fact, the OCaml type system often ensures correctness and speeds up computations without increasing verbosity, or hindering usability and readability. In many cases, we discovered that porting `python` code to `OCaml` code via `Owl` was nearly trivial and the resulting `OCaml` code was often comparable in length, but with the added benefits of fewer runtime errors and improved performance.
We look forward to developing `OwlDE` and `Owl` further with inputs from the `OCaml` community.
